# .NET Backend Service Template

Starting point for a backend microservice: a .NET 10 Clean Architecture solution,
the CI pipeline that guards it, and the branching flow that releases it.

Vocabulary is defined in [CONTEXT.md](./CONTEXT.md). Shared technical choices are
recorded in [BACKEND_TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md](./BACKEND_TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md),
and the decisions behind this repository's own shape in [docs/adr](./docs/adr).

## Structure

```text
Combat.Domain/          entities, enums, domain services, repository interfaces
Combat.Application/     commands, queries, handlers, validators, pipeline behaviours
Combat.Infrastructure/  EF Core, repository implementations, external services
Combat.Presentation/    HTTP API: controllers, DTOs, middleware
Combat.Contracts/       owned Protobuf contracts and generated gRPC client/server types
Combat.Test/            xUnit tests for all of the above
```

`Presentation` is the Clean Architecture layer name for the HTTP API. There is no
user interface.

## Commands

```powershell
dotnet tool restore
dotnet restore Combat.Presentation.slnx
dotnet build Combat.Presentation.slnx
dotnet test --solution Combat.Presentation.slnx
dotnet run --project Combat.Presentation/Combat.Presentation.csproj
```

## Internal gRPC contract

`Combat.Contracts` owns the versioned `combat_player_v1.proto` contract and the
generated C# gRPC types. It is referenced locally by the server projects; it never
pulls this service's Domain or Application types into the wire contract.

The template exposes `CombatPlayerService/GetPlayer` on its internal gRPC endpoint.
The REST API remains the client-facing interface. Locally, gRPC listens on
`http://localhost:8081`; Docker binds it only to loopback. In Kubernetes, expose
that port through an internal-only Service, never through the ingress.

Concrete gRPC service implementations in `Presentation/Grpc/Services` are mapped
automatically at startup. A new service only needs to inherit from its generated
contract base class; no additional `MapGrpcService<T>()` call is needed.

`Infrastructure/Grpc/Clients/PlayerGrpcClient` shows the consumer-side pattern.
Handlers depend on the `Application/Ports/IPlayerClient` port and its application
model, never on Protobuf or gRPC types. The adapter uses the generated typed client,
maps its response, and applies the configurable `Grpc:Player:TimeoutSeconds` deadline.

`Combat.Contracts` has an independent release line. A change outside
`Combat.Contracts/` never releases the package. When a contract release is made,
release-please creates a `contracts-vN.0.0` tag and `publish-contracts.yaml`
publishes the matching NuGet package to GitHub Packages. The contract number used
by consumers is therefore V1, V2, V3, and so on; minor and patch contract package
versions are deliberately never generated. A consuming repository configures its
NuGet source as `https://nuget.pkg.github.com/<organisation>/index.json` and pins a
released `Combat.Contracts` version.

The package page appears after the first release. To let a consuming repository's
GitHub Actions workflow restore the package without a personal token, grant that
repository `Read` access under **Package settings > Manage Actions access**. Its
workflow then needs `permissions: { packages: read }` and can authenticate its NuGet
source with the automatically-provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Developers authenticate once
on their own workstation with a personal access token (classic) scoped to
`read:packages`; neither kind of token belongs in a repository.

## Running the stack

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The API listens on <http://localhost:8080>, Postgres on host port 5433, and the
RabbitMQ management UI on <http://localhost:15672> (`combat` / `combat`). Because
`ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` is `Development`, the OpenAPI document is served at
`/openapi/v1.json` and the Scalar UI at `/scalar`.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health/live
curl http://localhost:8080/health/ready
docker compose down -v   # -v also drops the database volume
```

In Development, the application applies the service migrations and seeds example
players on startup. This template intentionally contains no EF Core migration:
create the initial migration after creating a service from it.

## Toolchain

The SDK version is pinned in `global.json`; `dotnet tool restore` installs the
coverage collector, EF Core Tools, CSharpier, and the git-hook runner declared in
`.config/dotnet-tools.json`.
Run `dotnet husky install` once per clone to enable the pre-commit hook — git
hook paths are local configuration and cannot be committed.

## Configuration

PostgreSQL is configured through the `ConnectionStrings` section.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=combat;Username=combat",
    "PasswordFile": "/run/secrets/postgres_password"
  }
}
```

`PasswordFile` is optional. It injects the password from a Docker or Kubernetes
secret instead of storing it in the configuration file.

## Database migrations

`Combat.Infrastructure` owns both the migrations and the design-time
`CombatDbContextFactory`, including the EF Core Design dependency. The factory
loads the Presentation configuration from the repository root and lets
`ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection` override it.

```powershell
dotnet tool restore
dotnet tool run dotnet-ef migrations add <MigrationName> --project Combat.Infrastructure --startup-project Combat.Infrastructure
dotnet tool run dotnet-ef database update --project Combat.Infrastructure --startup-project Combat.Infrastructure
```

Development startup applies migrations before seeding. Production-like deployments
must run migrations as a controlled rollout step, never by every application instance.

For host-based development, `appsettings.Development.json` targets the Compose
PostgreSQL port `5433`. The Compose API uses its own `postgres:5432` connection.

## Asynchronous messaging

`IMessagePublisher` is the application seam for integration messages; its
`MessageEnvelope` contains no RabbitMQ type. `RabbitMqMessagePublisher` is the
RabbitMQ adapter registered when `RabbitMq:Enabled` is true. It serializes the
broker-independent Protobuf envelope from `combat_events_v1.proto`, declares the
durable `combat.events` topic exchange, and publishes each event with the routing
key `<type>.v<version>`.

Creating a player publishes `combat.player.created.v1`, whose payload is the
versioned `PlayerCreated` Protobuf message. In Compose, the adapter connects to
the `rabbitmq` service. For a local run without the broker, leave `Enabled` false;
the no-op adapter keeps the application runnable while preserving the same
application interface.

## Branching flow

```text
feature/xxx --merge commit--> dev --merge commit--> main --> tag + CHANGELOG
                         ^                      |
                         +----- back-merge -----+
```

- `dev` is the default branch. Open every feature pull request against it and
  merge it with a **merge commit**: every commit keeps its author and its own
  line in the history.
- Promote by opening a pull request from `dev` to `main`, also merged with a
  **merge commit**. Never squash or rebase — release-please reads the individual
  commits ([ADR-0002](./docs/adr/0002-merge-strategy-depends-on-the-target-branch.md)).
- release-please then maintains independent release pull requests on `main` for
  the application and the Protocol Buffer contracts. Merging one writes its
  changelog, bumps only its version and tags it (`vX.Y.Z` for the application,
  `contracts-vN.0.0` for contracts).
- A back-merge from `main` to `dev` follows automatically
  ([ADR-0003](./docs/adr/0003-automatic-back-merge-from-main-to-dev.md)).

Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org):
`feat:` and `fix:` appear in the changelog and move the version, everything else
(`chore:`, `ci:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `build:`, `style:`) is hidden and
moves nothing. Since every commit reaches `main`, every commit message is checked:
by a `commit-msg` hook locally and by the `Commitlint` job in CI. The full rules
are in [docs/GIT_RULES.md](./docs/GIT_RULES.md).

## Continuous integration

| Workflow | Runs on | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ci.yaml` | PR to `dev` / `main`, push to `main` | Calls the reusable lint, test and build workflows |
| `commitlint.yaml` | PR to `dev` / `main` | Checks every commit message of the pull request |
| `sonar.yaml` | PR and push to `dev`, except Dependabot | Builds and tests under the SonarScanner for .NET, uploads coverage |
| `security.yml` | PR to `dev` / `main`, push to `main` | Trivy filesystem scan, zizmor workflow audit |
| `release-please.yaml` | push to `main` | Maintains the release pull request |
| `back-merge.yaml` | after a release | Opens and merges `main` → `dev` |

Formatting is enforced by `dotnet csharpier check .`. CSharpier runs locally on
staged C# files through Husky.Net, alongside a `commit-msg` hook checking the
Conventional Commits format. Run `dotnet tool restore` then `dotnet husky install`
once per clone.

## Integration tests

`Combat.Test/Integration` contains runnable examples for both a REST controller
and a gRPC service. They use `WebApplicationFactory`, PostgreSQL and Respawn.
Start the database with `docker compose up -d postgres`, then run:

```powershell
dotnet test --solution Combat.Presentation.slnx --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Integration"
```

Each fixture creates and drops a unique database, then applies the service
migrations. Set
`COMBAT_TEST_DATABASE_CONNECTION` to use another administrative PostgreSQL
connection; it is never reset itself.

## Setting up a new repository from this template

1. Create the repository **public** (SonarQube Cloud's free tier requires it).
2. Import the organisation into SonarQube Cloud and create the project, then:
   - **Branches**: delete the `dev` entry SonarQube Cloud created on its own,
     then rename the main branch from `main` to `dev` — the rename is refused
     while a branch of that name already exists. The free plan covers one
     long-lived branch, and `dev` is the one that matters (ADR-0005).
   - **Administration → Analysis method**: switch **Automatic Analysis off**.
     Left on, it competes with the scanner and every CI analysis fails.
   - **Administration → New code**: number of days, 30.
3. Add `SONAR_TOKEN` and `BOT_TOKEN` as secrets. `BOT_TOKEN`, not the default
   `GITHUB_TOKEN`: a pull request opened by the latter triggers no workflow, so
   the release pull request would never get a CI run.
4. Set `dev` as the default branch and protect both `dev` and `main`. Required
   checks: `Lint / CSharpier`, `Test / dotnet test`, `Build / dotnet build`,
   `Trivy Security Scan`, `GitHub Actions audit`, `Commitlint`. **Not** `SonarQube Cloud scan`:
   it is skipped on Dependabot pull requests, and a required check that never
   runs blocks them forever. Keep "require linear history" **off**, or the merge
   commits this flow depends on become impossible.
5. Add one ruleset on `dev` and `main` allowing **merge commits** only, so the
   merge strategy is enforced rather than merely written down (ADR-0007). No
   bypass is needed. Disable squash and rebase merging in the repository
   settings too.
6. Enable auto-merge on the repository; the back-merge workflow uses it.
7. Rename the `Combat.*` projects to your service name, and update `/k:` and
   `/o:` in `.github/workflows/sonar.yaml`.
