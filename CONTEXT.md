# Player Backend Context

The vocabulary and conventions used by the Player microservice: a .NET Clean
Architecture solution, the CI pipeline that guards it, and the branching flow
that releases it.

## Language

### Branching and release

**Feature branch**:
A short-lived branch carrying one unit of work. It merges into `dev`, never into
`main`.
_Avoid_: topic branch, working branch

**dev**:
The integration branch, and the repository's default branch. Every feature lands
here first, and it is the branch static analysis treats as the reference.
_Avoid_: develop, integration, trunk

**main**:
The branch carrying released versions: tags, `CHANGELOG.md`, and the version in
the project file. It only ever receives `dev`.
_Avoid_: master, release branch, production branch

**Promotion**:
Merging `dev` into `main`. It moves already-integrated work into the released
line; it neither builds nor deploys anything by itself.
_Avoid_: release, deploy, ship

**Release**:
The tag and changelog entry that release-please produces on `main` once a
promotion lands. A release is a marker, not an act of publishing.
_Avoid_: version bump, publish

**Back-merge**:
Merging `main` back into `dev` after a release, so `dev` regains the changelog
and version written by release-please. Without it, every promotion conflicts.
_Avoid_: sync, reverse merge, downstream merge

**Deployment**:
Running a released version somewhere. This template does not perform one — it
stops at the release.
_Avoid_: release, rollout

**New code**:
The subset of the codebase static analysis judges on a pull request: what
changed relative to the reference branch. Quality thresholds apply to it, not to
the repository as a whole.
_Avoid_: diff, delta, changed lines

**Required check**:
A CI job whose success gates a merge. A check that can be skipped by a path
filter must never be required — it would block the pull request forever.
_Avoid_: gate, status

### Service structure

**Player**:
The microservice that owns the player's business identity, heroes, matchmaking,
and game-session lifecycle. It does not own technical authentication, inventory,
equipment, a dungeon run, or combat resolution.

**Game session**:
A Player-owned game lifecycle record. It is not an authentication session and
not a Dungeon-owned dungeon run.

**Hero**:
A Player-owned character belonging to one player and one hero class. It may be
soft-deleted only after active references have been released.

**Matchmaking group**:
A Player-owned, formed set of compatible matchmaking entries. It can result in
one game session after the roster is locked.

**Idempotency key**:
A stable key associated with a player command and its request fingerprint. A
retry returns the recorded outcome instead of performing the transition again.

**Microservice**:
One deployable service, living in one repository, owning its own database. There
are five.
_Avoid_: service, app, module

**Presentation**:
The project holding the HTTP API — controllers, DTOs, middleware. Named for the
Clean Architecture layer, not for any user interface; there is none.
_Avoid_: API, Web, Host

**Command**:
A request to change state, named for the use case it performs.
_Avoid_: action, operation, mutation

**Query**:
A request to read state, which changes nothing.
_Avoid_: getter, fetch, lookup

**Handler**:
The application-layer class executing exactly one command or query. It
orchestrates; it holds no HTTP concern and no business invariant of its own.
_Avoid_: service, manager, processor

**Repository**:
The abstraction through which the domain reaches persistence, declared in the
domain and implemented in infrastructure.
_Avoid_: DAO, store, gateway

**Message envelope**:
The fixed metadata wrapping every asynchronous message — identity, causation,
type, version, origin, time — around an opaque payload.
_Avoid_: header, wrapper, metadata block

**Contract version**:
The major version of a message or HTTP API, carried in its name or route.
Additive changes keep it; removals and meaning changes require a new one.
_Avoid_: schema version, revision
